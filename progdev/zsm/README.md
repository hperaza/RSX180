# [ZSM 4.6](http://p112.sourceforge.net/index.php?zsm4), a Z80/Z180/Z280 Macro Assembler

ZSM 4.6 is a macro-assembler for the Z80, Z180 and Z280 microprocessors.
It uses standard Zilog/Mostek mnemonics, supports conditional assembly and
produces a REL file suitable for linking with Microsoft's L80 or Digital
Research's LINK. ZSM 4.6 is a disk based assembler, i.e. source code is
read from disk, the resulting object code is written to disk and an optional
print file can be written to disk. Alternatively the print file can be
redirected to the console or to the printer.
