	The language is pretty much fixed right now.

	T.SEEK will probably not be implemented, because it would need
	a lot of space.

	The T3X.OAPPND mode of T.OPEN might be an option, but it is hard
	to get right for text files.

	Maybe later:

	There are currently no unsigned operators (./ .< .> .<= .>=).
