	The language is pretty much fixed right now.

	T.SEEK will probably not be implemented, because it would need
	a lot of space.

	The T3X.OAPPND mode of T.OPEN might be an option, but it is hard
	to get right for text files.

	Maybe later:

	There are currently no unsigned operators (./ .< .> .<= .>=).

	Local storage should be deallocated when branching out of a loop.
	E.g.:

	FOR (i=0, 100) DO VAR foo;
	    LEAVE;
	END

	should deallocate the space for FOO. The compiler currently does
	not do this, and the program will crash. Caveat utilitor!
