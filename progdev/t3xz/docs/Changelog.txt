- First quick port of T3X/Z V1.6 to RSX180/280. Runtime library ported, except
  for the t_bdos and t_bdoshl functions.

- Summary output only if /V is specified on the command line (thus, no longer
  output by default, to match the "silent" behavior of RSX applications).

- Prefix error messages with 'T3X -- ' as per RSX conventions.

- Default to .T3X file extension.

- Generate task file header:
  * Remember top of text segment after first pass so we can initialize the
    header fields accordingly.
  * Use the file name as default task name.
  * The file is created non-contiguous as the necessary library support is
    not there yet.

- Close Infile and Outfile on error to avoid RSX180/280 complaining about
  about "exit with outstanding I/O".

- Create output file only during the second pass, else RSX will produce two
  versions of the file.

- CG_HALT now passes the argument of the 'halt' statement to the exit routine.

- First successful compilation of the compiler under RSX180/280!

- The default ("success") exit code under RSX180/280 is 1 and not 0 (0 means
  "warning").

- Report code and data size, number of symbols, etc. as unsigned decimal.
