directories, copying, and renaming files.

\DIR

Command format:

  PIP [outfile=][dev:[dir]]/sw

where switch can be:

  /LI    - display directory of mounted device
  /BR    - display brief directory, can be used alone or together with /LI
  /FU    - display full dir info, can be used alone or together with /LI
  /FR    - display free space
  /ID    - display PIP version

\FIL*E

Single-file operations:

  PIP [dev:[dir]]file/sw

where switch can be:

  /DE                  - delete file
  /SD                  - selective delete
  /PU:n                - purge to the specified number of single copies
                         (n is optional and defaults to 1)
  /LD                  - list deleted files, used with /PU or /DE
  /UN                  - unlock file
  /PR:[rwed,rwed,rwed,rwed] - set file protection
  /OW:[group,user]     - set file ownership
  /NM                  - suppress "file not found" messages

\COP*Y

Multiple file operations:

  PIP dest[/sw0]=src1[/sw1][,src2[/sw2]] etc.

where sw0 (for output file) can be:

  /CO  - make output file contiguous
  /-CO - make output file non-contiguous (default is to make output
         file of same type as original), /NOCO is also allowed
  /PR:[rwed,rwed,rwed,rwed] - set output file protection
  /OW:[user,group]          - set output file ownership

and sw1, sw2, etc. (for input files) can be:

  /NV - force new version of output file
  /SU - supersede an existing version of the output file
  /ME - merge files into a single output file
  /AP - append files to an existing file
  /RE - rename file; the /CO output switch is not allowed
  /CD - preserve creation date
  /NM - suppress "file not found" messages

Examples:

  PIP dy1:[user2]=dy1:[user1]*.mac;*
  PIP outfile.txt=file1.txt,file2.txt,[user5]file3.txt

  PIP =[user2]*.mac     ; copies to current directory on SY: (implicit)
  PIP DU2:=*.TXT;*      ; copies to current dir on device DU2:
  PIP test.txt=TI:      ; creates file from console input
  PIP TI:=test.txt      ; displays file on the terminal

Notes on wildcards:

  The asterisk '*' matches a group of chars, while the percent sign '%'
  matches a single char.

  The asterisk can be specified anywhere and in any combination with other
  characters, including other asterisks and percent signs e.g.: A*, *A, *A*,
  *A*B, *A*B% etc.
