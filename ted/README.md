# [TED](http://p112.sourceforge.net/index.php?ted) - Text Editor

This is a clone of the editor of the same name that once was available for
the DEC's RT-11 OS.

It is not identical to the original. In particular, this version implements
smart tab handling like the old Borland editors did (the original simply
converted all tabs to spaces), and has a different set of screen editing
commands which is more WordStar-like.

This version is for a Z80 CPU and runs under CP/M or RSX180. Can edit files
larger than the available RAM, up to approx 1Mbyte.
